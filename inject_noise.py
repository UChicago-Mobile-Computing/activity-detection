Write a script that takes your validation set, injects Gaussian noise of different
variances, and saves this set to a separate directory. If your group is also completing
the bonus task, this script should also be able to inject noise on the test set.

Be sure to include documentation with clear instructions on how to run the script
here or in your report.
