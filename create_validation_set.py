"""

Write a script that takes in labeled data in data/train/ and
outputs the validation dataset in data/validation/.

You may also want to create a modified data/train/ folder
(or a modified copy of the folder) that does not include you validation
data. Be sure to document how to run this script here or in your report.

Your validation set should contain at least 10 samples of IMU data per
activity, with each sample being 5+ seconds long.
